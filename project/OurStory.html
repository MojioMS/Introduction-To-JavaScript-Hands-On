<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>The story began as we took the <b>"An Introduction to JavaScript and linked data"</b> 
course offered by <b>Dr. Tomi Kauppinen, Aalto University- Finland</b> and <b>Dr. Auriol Degbelo, University of Muenster- Germany</b>.
 The course structure supported us in learning the techniques to provide dynamic interactivity on the web through JavaScript 
 and to understand a set of practices for publishing and connecting different datasets on the Web through linked data technique.</p>
<p>
The Topics and concepts covered in this course include JavaScript, jQuery, Leaflet, GeoJSON, Bootstrap, Linked data and Geo-linked data, 
RDF and RDFs, Querying linked data, Data Visualization and Open source licenses.  
</p>
<p>The goal of this course is create a project that involves turning some open data from Muenster into linked open data and visualizing it 
and making the work available under the appropriate license.  Different data that include unemployment, population, migration, households, 
and employees subject to social insurance contributions were assigned to different groups participating in the course.
</p>
<p>Our group consisting 3 members is assigned to work with the employees subject to social insurance contributions data. 
We split the work as frontâ€“end and Back-end and finally produced this awesome website that enables the user to know, compare, understand, 
plan and predict the social insurance contribution of the employees in the Muenster city.
